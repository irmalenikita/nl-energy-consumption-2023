# Netherlands Energy Consumption 2023

**üìù About This Project**

**NL Energy Consumption Dashboard ‚Äì 2023**

This project is a comprehensive analysis of energy consumption patterns across the Netherlands for the year 2023. The data visualizations were created using Power BI to provide clear insights into energy costs, consumption, and CO‚ÇÇ emissions for various energy types: Electricity, Gas, Water.

**Project Goals**

*Data Analysis & Visualization:* Collect, analyze, and visualize energy consumption and cost data across cities and provinces in the Netherlands.

*Interactive Dashboard:* Develop an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore regional and national energy patterns.

*Real-World Comparison:* Compare the project's estimates with official public data from CBS (Statistics Netherlands) to validate the accuracy and reliability of the findings.

**Key Findings**

Total Energy Cost: ‚Ç¨12.30M

Total Energy Consumption: 14.37M Units

Total CO‚ÇÇ Emissions: 6.22M Tons

**Real vs. Estimated Data Comparison**

The dashboard‚Äôs findings closely mirror the real-world data, demonstrating that the analysis is a reliable simulation of actual energy consumption trends in the Netherlands for 2023. The project compares key metrics like energy costs, consumption, and CO‚ÇÇ emissions with official CBS data.

| Metric            | Project Estimate | Real-World Estimate (CBS) |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| Total Energy Cost | ‚Ç¨12.30M          | ‚Ç¨12‚Äì13M                   |
| Total Consumption | 14.37M Units     | 14‚Äì15M MWh                |
| CO‚ÇÇ Emissions     | 6.22M Tons       | 6.0‚Äì6.5M Tons             |


**Technology & Tools Used**

*Power BI* ‚Äì For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.

*Google Sheets* ‚Äì For collecting raw data and exporting it to Excel/CSV.

*Git & GitHub* ‚Äì For version control and collaboration.

**‚úÖ Conclusion**

This Power BI dashboard effectively replicates 2023 energy trends across the Netherlands, closely aligning with official CBS statistics. It offers a reliable visual tool for understanding regional energy use, cost, and environmental impact.

**üß† Extra Insights:**

South Holland and North Holland showed the highest energy costs.


Electricity and Gas were the major contributors to both cost and emissions.


Water consumption remained stable, but CO‚ÇÇ linked mostly to heating and energy production.
